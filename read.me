 feature that allows me to connect to the guidance database and send a result query to the language model. Please check how vector stores work in the Llama index.





The provided code demonstrates an example implementation that connects to a guidance database and uses the Llama index for querying and obtaining responses from the language model. Here's an explanation of the code:

Importing necessary modules: The required modules such as pymongo, os, and relevant components from the Llama index and LangChain libraries are imported.

Setting the OpenAI API key: The OpenAI API key is set as an environment variable using os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] to authenticate API requests.

Establishing a connection to the guidance database: The code establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using the pymongo library. The MongoDB connection URL and database details are provided to create a connection to the desired collection.

Initializing the node parser: A node parser is initialized to extract information from the documents in the index. In this case, the SimpleNodeParser is used.

Defining the construct_index function: This function constructs the Llama index from the documents in a specified directory. It takes the directory path as an argument and returns the constructed index.

Inside the construct_index function:

Various parameters related to index construction, such as max_input_size, num_outputs, chunk_overlap_ratio, and chunk_size_limit, are set.
A SimpleDirectoryReader is created to load the data/documents from the specified directory.
The PromptHelper and LLMPredictor instances are initialized to assist with generating prompts and predicting responses using the OpenAI language model.
A ServiceContext is created using the LLMPredictor and PromptHelper instances.
The GPTVectorStoreIndex is constructed from the loaded documents and the service context.
The constructed index is persisted to a specified directory using the persist method of StorageContext.
The constructed index is returned.
Calling the construct_index function: The construct_index function is called with the path of the directory containing the documents ("./docs") to create the Llama index. The persisted index is saved in the "./entire_docs" directory.

Creating a StorageContext and loading the index: A StorageContext is created with the directory path where the index was persisted. The load_index_from_storage function is then used to load the index from the specified storage context.

Initializing the query engine: The loaded index is converted into a query engine, which allows for querying the index and retrieving responses. The query engine is stored in the query_engine variable.

Entering an interactive loop: The code enters an infinite loop to interact with the user as a chatbot.

User input is obtained using input("YOU : ").
The code retrieves the guidance result associated with the user's input from the database. If a guidance result is found, the guidance text is appended to the user's input.
The query engine is used to query the index with the modified user input, and the response from the model is obtained.
The response is printed as the bot's reply, along with a newline character ('\n'), to format the output.
The loop continues, allowing the user to enter new input and obtain responses.
Please note that the code assumes the necessary installations of packages and correct setup of the MongoDB database, including the presence of documents in the specified directory ("./docs").
